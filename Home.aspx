        What is “Home Staging” and How Does it Help Sell My House?</h2>
    by <a href="http://www.centerstagehome.com" target="_blank">Lori Matzke</a><br />
    <p>
        “Home staging” is not a new term, but for many homeowners and real estate agents
        the concept of “professional home staging” is shedding new light on how to promote
        a home in the real estate marketplace.&nbsp; In past years, homeowners were left
        to their own discretion as far as preparing for home showings. Though they could
        occasionally rely on an agent for instructions, more often than not real estate
        agents were just as perplexed at working out the details as the homeowner.</p>
    <p>
        While agents are experts in the field of selling and closing, many are not design
        savvy.&nbsp; Agents usually know exactly what factors can help sell a home. It’s
        just not always easy to get a home into selling condition in a timely manner without
        some sort of experienced assistance.</p>
    <p>
        Professional home stagers are practiced in the art of preparing a home for resale.
        They work with the “flow” of a home, eliminate clutter, edit and arrange furniture,
        and even assist in enhancing curb-appeal.&nbsp; With the aid of a professional home
        stager, your house can make a notable first impression on potential homebuyers.</p>
    <h5>

    <p>
        As the real estate industry often stresses, the first impression is the key factor
        in selling your home. &nbsp;Typically,” says Jan Van Horne of Coldwell Banker Burnet
        Realty in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, “a potential buyer has made up their mind ten
        seconds after they step in the front door.&nbsp; They were already forming an opinion
        as they pulled into your driveway!” That really doesn’t leave too much room for
        fault.</p>
    <p>
        “To achieve the greatest possible outcome,” Jan adds, “a home should always be presented
        at its best the first time around.”</p>

    <p>
        You find and select a professional home stager much like you would find any other
        professional service. Ask around and get referrals. Check with your real estate
        agent. A number of larger real estate companies offer access to a listing of professional
        home services in your area. These individuals and companies have often already been
        pre-screened by the real estate agencies or their agents.</p>
    <h5>
        <a name="How Much Does it Cost">How Much Does it Cost?</a></h5>
    <p>
        When you contact a home stager, ask for an estimate. Most home staging businesses
        will be happy to give you a free estimate and it is usually a quick process. Keep
        in mind that this is only an estimate and estimates can be a bit off. &nbsp;However,
        unless something unforeseen takes place between the estimate and the actual job
        itself, an estimate should be fairly accurate.</p>
    <p>
        Get several free estimates and make some calculations.&nbsp; Just like any service,
        pricing in the home staging industry can vary over a wide range. Some charge an
        hourly rate and some will charge you a set fee for the entire job. Be sure to ask
        how they determine their fee so that you can make an educated decision. Also, factor
        in the condition of your home, the average amount of time homes have been on the
        market in your area, and the asking price of your home.</p>
    <p>
        Asking price can play a huge factor in what a homeowner should be willing to pay
        for staging services. Some professional home stagers bring in rented furnishings,
        driving the price up considerably. Some simply charge too much to make it pay off.
        &nbsp;A lot of home stagers seem to forget that their clients are planning on moving
        out of the house very soon. Most home sellers are not willing to invest a huge amount
        of cash in a house they are planning on leaving behind.</p>
    <p>
        Find out up front what the stager is planning to bring in and at what cost. Though
        expert services do come at a price, the cost should balance with the expected benefit
        of a higher selling price. As a rule, the higher the asking price of the home, the
        more one can spend to have it professionally staged.</p>

    <p>
        In some instances, it makes sense for a real estate agent to contribute to the cost
        of professionally staging a home.&nbsp; “As a real estate agent,” says Tony Cirelli,
        a Minnesota Re/Max agent from Apple Valley, “I have to look at profit margins. I
        analyze current market trends and what will be spent on advertising before dropping
        any cash into staging.”</p>
    <p>
        Pat Cirelli, Tony’s wife and partner, agrees.&nbsp; “For the most part, an agent
        should be able to determine if a home is in need of this type of service, and if
        it would be of benefit or not. If you know it would be in the homeowner’s best interest
        and if you know that something will need to be done before the home is listed, it
        might be wise to set aside an amount of your marketing budget for staging. If it’s
        a reasonable fee, it is usually a worthwhile investment. It could certainly make
        all the difference in your showing.”</p>
